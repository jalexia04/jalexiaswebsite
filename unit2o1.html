<h1>Unit 2 - Outcome 1</h1>
<br>
<h2> 1.1-Describing the content and layout for each page </h2>
<p>I have a page title list across the header making it accessible for all users to navigate my site  
<br>
My website layout is simple and informative with the exciting use of pink and grey tones and light pink Arial font 
<br>
Use css to keep page rules as unobtrusive as possible, allowing the layout and colour throughout the pages
<br>

For all kinds of logical, editorial, accessibility, search visibility, and common-sense reasons, use an h1 heading at the top of the page to let users know what the page is about.
<br>
Navigation with Paging. It is useful to provide easy text links at the top and bottom of the page in multi-page sequences to transfer the reader to the previous or next pages in the series. 
<br>
It is useful in longer sequences to have data explaining where they are in the series. 
<br>
The canonical form of page headers is dominated by horizontal bands of links and tools
</p>

<h2>1.2- Describing copyright and other constraints affecting website </h2>
<br>
<p>The Copyright (Computer Programs) Regulations 1992, a supplementary statute, extends rights to software usually protected by copyright-specific laws and agencies. 
<br>
Works are protected upon development, ensuring you receive copyright protection as soon as you publish your website. 
<br>
. Furthermore, the U.K. Registration is strongly recommended by the Copyright Service because websites are vulnerable to infringement and a civil cause of action is enabled by that procedure.
<br>
Individuals see the pages of a website in multiple viewports, that is, screens of different sizes. 
<br>
And then you have to build pages that appear on cell phones and maybe even on wall-sized screens that are projected.
<br>
Flexibly building. Account for the fact that your designs will be stretched and distorted by viewers. 
<br>
For example, considering that text can expand when a user zooms in on your page, if you design with versatility, you can create page designs that bend but do not split when viewed in different environments.
<br>
Discussing other people's trademarks: There is nothing inherently wrong with labelling the goods of other parties on a web page using their trademarks.
<br>
Nonetheless, any time they see one of their logos on the page of another party, several parties have made unfair allegations of trademark infringement.
<br>
Often, however, a website violates the trademarks of another.

<div class="container">
<h2>
1.3-Describing access issues that need taking into account people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them. 
</h2>
<p>Since my website has a basic page layout with low use of images and no audio, individuals with physical disabilities will struggle to navigate my website.
    <br>
    . As motor disabilities have a loss of mobility or paralysis that can restrict the feeling of the arms and fingers. 
    <br>
    Of addition, my websites do not have the resources to facilitate a screen magnifier with the use of html combined with css.
    <br>
    Next, diligent preparation and analysis to find the most appropriate way to support people with learning disabilities, such as incorporating the Sound Warning Method to help the disabled.
</p>

</header>
<body class="container">
<h2>1.4-Describe which are the appropriate file types for websites </h2>
<br>
<p>After assessing the various types of files to facilitate an efficient website. I decided to pick three file types that are appropriate for new developer:
    <br>
    Html 
    <br> 
    Every few years, HTML is updated to make room for changes. To monitor how your pages are viewed and make pages more available, Cascading Stylesheets are used. 
    <br>
    JavaScript, which adds a lot of power to basic HTML, offers basic special effects and interaction. 
    <br>
    Much of this advanced stuff is down the road for later, but you have a lot of control at your disposal by using all of these technology together.
    <br>         
    PNG/JPEG
    <br>              
 Unlike JPEGs, PNGs also give you power over transparency, making them pretty much ideal for logos. 
   <br>       
 Lossless compression is often used for PNGs, meaning they do not sacrifice any data or consistency. 
   <br>
 However, one of the main drawbacks of using PNGs is that they are not supported by some web browsers.its great for uploading pictures on your website 
       <br> 
 It simply won't show if your logo is saved as a PNG and someone is browsing your website on a browser that doesn't support them.
       <br>
       css
       <br>
       The traditional way to describe the presentation of your HTML pages, from fonts and colours to the full layout of a website, is now with cascading style sheets. 
       <br>
       They are much more successful at describing the look of your website than using HTML on every page. 
       <br>
       CSS is becoming an everyday language that is more important to know, so the faster you have a grasp on this most elegant of presentational languages, the better. 
       <br>
       This tool can be beneficial when it comes to the background, font-text, and colour of all your webpages.
