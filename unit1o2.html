</div><h2>  2.1- Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used?</h2>
<p>The visual studio code was a tool use to  while processing codes as it has built in support such as Intellisense  code which proves me with pop up word suggestions  for code completion making its to understand for a new developer who just started in the industry. 
    <br>
    Furthermore, allows the debugging process to run smoothly and easier to manage compared to other technology tools 
    <br>
    As a user this tool has many pitfall such as freezing spontaneously can delay the progress of my website .The constant need to have to uninstall and reinstall can be rather frustrating .
    <br>
    Trello has been really helpful I certainly happy with tool as I receive regular updates on tasks completed, easy to set date deadlines.

<h2>2.2- Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</h2>
    <p>I think it’s great for a beginner developer   with the support and guidance to carefully execute the codes.
        <br>
        As there are build scripting tools to perform daily tasks mean it reduces the level workflow throughout the day which improve the efficiency of my work. 
            <br>
            . Less stressful as I can focus on this tool that covers all necessary base of my project. 
            <br>
        . Trello board allows developers to customizable lists and measure the metrics that I’m most interested in with instant  automatic alerts .

        <h2>2.3-Assses the strength and weaknesses of your final project </h2>
    <p>I had an issue with my vs code as the screen kept on freezing which delayed the progress of my website. I have to acknowledge the fact, that there is still room for improvement .
        <br>
        For example the graphics lacked commercial ability with boring use of colour and the simple font text .
        <br>
        As I’m a first time developer a have certainly come a long way before form never have heard of vs code and varies types of function to facilitate a successful site. I can edit and produce an effective codes 
        <br>
        I will continue grow and gain a deeper understanding of HTML.

            <h2>2.4-Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h2>
        <p>To complete a good project, preparation and trimming is necessary.
            <br>
            The lack of time during this project meant that I had to scale down to my list of perfections such as the layout and flashy photographs, videos. 
            <br>
            . Next time I will learn and improve the skills needed to implement this project.
            <br>
                Using an S.W.O.T analysis would have helped to address the key issues and play to my strengths. (MITCHELL GRANT- Feb 24, 2020)

            <h2>2.5- Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h2>
            <p>Upon reviewing my plan I made on Trello concerning my project enabled me to set tasks and clear daily objectives to help me keep track of my progress.
                <br>
                I would say that my website is fit for purpose as I believe users will be able to navigate my website with little to no struggle as my navigation bar is at the top of my home  page  making it easy for individuals  to search through the site and its informative surrounding the facts of technology in the digtal world  .
