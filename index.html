        <br>
    <p>My name is jalexia, I graduated with honours studying business management.
        <br>
        im currently in the process of completing my masters in finance and project management.
        <br>
        I am multilingual can speak three different languages Twi, Hebrew, English.
        <br>
        I used to work as an administrator in a youth group facilitating the meeting and run daily activities.
        <br>
        I previously modelled for a company called UK models for a short time to earn some extra money. 
        <br>
        after years of working in retail with a low wage and spear heading numurous charities , felt as if my days were
        reapative and dull i needed a sense of purpose.
        <br> 
        I decided to choose <a href="http://wearecodenation.com/">codenation</a>, to new something new and exciting career change.
