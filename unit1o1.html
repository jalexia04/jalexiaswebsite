        <br>
        It helps a company to increase value and increase efficiency

    <br>
    . There are many issues to tackle, and no day is going to be the same
    <br>
    . A useful tool that the internet are HTML / CSS. The ability to write in HTML enables DPMs in a pinch to assist designers or developers

    <h2>1.3-Plan and carry out tasks using IT-eg. Making your website</h2>
    <p>I can carefully design my website using a Kanban called trello-wide tools to set my daily goals and allow me to determine which tasks are done, so i don't fall behind.
        <br>
        -	structure your website for example I would decide how many pages am I going to have and are going to be my essential features on my websites such as about page ,contents page 
        <br>
        -	Design- making sure the pages are slick and professional with suitable font and layout. Choose a background colour and text colour that contrast well 
        <br>
        -	To get out bugs and catch information that you may have missed initially, testing is important.
-	      <br>
        -Site to have a consistent appearance regardless of the screen it appears on. Make sure that all the connexions work, that the photos are correctly sized, and that all the placeholders have been replaced with actual material. Make sure that all the forms and other input fields function( Taylor Hawes, September 26.2013)

<h2>1.4- Describe the risks that might impact digital projects</h2>
<p>Lack of cross-functional expertise: Like number 1, there is a common misconception that only "tech people" are required for digital projects. 
    <br>
    But each digital project should involve someone with business process management experience to help scope and schedule the coordination between the customer journey and organisational back-end processes.
    <br>
    Business process misalignment: Marketing will produce a beautiful new website with a fantastic user interface, but the project is very likely to fail if they ignore the resulting effects on the business processes of the organisation.
    <br>
    . This also occurs when teams place technology ahead of policy, before understanding the business process ramifications of the latest technology, falling for the hype of fresh revolutionary tools. 
    <br>
    To project performance, it is important to match digital and company priorities and incorporate new products seamlessly with business operations.
    <br>
    Lack of vision: technology advances rapidly, it is important to look beyond the currently available technologies and explore and invest in new and emerging technologies while embarking on digital transformation.
    <br>
    In order to avoid risks in the digital project you should consider increasing usability in web design. Website sites are constantly interchanging you have to comply with latest standards to build a successful website. 
    <br>
    Furthermore it’s essential to assess unnecessary HTML codes as it could be slowing the process of the site and lower your ranking on google.(Richard Adams-Jan 29, 2015)

<h2>1.5 -Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software </h2>
<p>Designing an e-portfolio layout with a title page linking to topics of interest, listing the sources of information used for input, the software resources they would use to include in their portfolio information processing, and the intended audience for their finished product.
    <br>  
    In order to make information easily available, I would take the necessary requirements by access the functional abilities and if the software meets the needs of my website .
    <br>
    HTML codes will enable me to navigate my web pages making it user friendly, as it provides one with opportunity to insert pictures and variable web links  
    
</p>

<br>
<br>
<h2>1.6 -Describe and provide analysis on how do your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcome.</h2>
<p>Using an online tool ensures that all parties can sign in when they need to, when updates are made, they can turn on or off notifications and can access the data anywhere, anywhere. 
<br>
Trello digital strategy is basically the concept of putting several different digital platforms together, it is easiest to measure and monitor the performance of these networks in one place. 
<br>
For example I focus on the website (blog) , Having a card for each blog post works very well and is the ideal place to prepare a content strategy.
<br>
To help visualise how the post is progressing, red for not starting, orange for in progress and green for full, I like to use the Trello labelling method. 
<br>
Upload files that can be useful for transferring data throughout the project coupled with having the ability the fact I can link my website. 
<br>
Trello gives me the chance integrate other website to keep track of my hard work and can cut down admin time by half (PIERS TINCKNELL, august 4, 2016).
<br>
Trello backlogs all your necessary tasks during the course of the project using a software called the agile methodology to showcase the most desirable features 
<br>
It allows a developer to stay ahead  of all the daily task as it’s an effective way to manage my learning.
<br>
Github can help your process the codes more efficiently, It will automatically make a page with details about the owner's profile, including a picture, bio, and repositories. 
<br>
Software repositories are "open source," which ensures that they are available to the public to browse in the world. 
<br>
As this makes easier for me as a developer to publish my webpage with effective and will allows to analyse areas in which I could improve on so my codes can run smoothly .

<h2> 1.7-Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects    </h2>
<p>Under the GDPR Directive, personal data is any person-related information such as name, photo, e-mail address, bank details, social networking website updates, location details, medical information, or IP addresses of a device
<br>
Under GDPR standards, the conditions for obtaining consent are stricter as the applicant must have the right to revoke consent at any time and there is a presumption that consent will not be valid unless separate consents for various processing activities are obtained. 
<br>
This means that, for example, to obtain a newsletter, you have to be able to show that the person agreed to a certain action.
<br>
The presumption or insertion of a disclaimer is not permitted and it is not necessary to include an opt-out option. In order to be consistent with double opt-in regulations and email marketing best practises, businesses had to review business processes, applications and forms
<br>
To sign up for contact, prospects would need to fill out a questionnaire or check a box and then confirm in a further email that it was their acts.</p>
